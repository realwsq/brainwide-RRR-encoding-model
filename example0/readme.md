This subfolder includes a minimum example where you can load a preprocessed dataset of one example IBL session, including the trial-aligned time-varying neural activity (y) and input variables (X), and train a reduced-rank regression model that predicts the neural activity (y) given the input variables (X). 

To execute this toy example, cd to the main folder and run `python -m example0.train_RRR`
