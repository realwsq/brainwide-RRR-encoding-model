# brainwide-RRR-encoding-model

🚧 *This project is under active development. Stay tuned for updates!* 🚧

## Overview

This project implements a simple but efficient linear encoding model for describing the single-neuron, task-driven responses.
See `RRR_poster.pdf` for detailed information about the implemented encoding model.

## Current Status

You can find the minimum code to fit a reduced-rank regression (RRR) encoding model in this repo.

The core functions are implemented in `RRRGD.py` and `RRRGD_main_CV.py`. 
Check `train_RRR.py` for example usage of fitting the model to an IBL session with 100 trials.

I am

-   📖 preparing more demos and better documentation.
-   💻 preparing to release codes for other linear encoding models (e.g., general linear model, another variant of RRR model).
