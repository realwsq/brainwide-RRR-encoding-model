# brainwide-RRR-encoding-model

## Overview

This project implements a simple but efficient linear encoding model for describing the single-neuron, task-driven responses.
See (Methods of) [1] for detailed information about the implemented encoding model.

## Current Status

The core functions are implemented in `RRRGD.py` and `RRRGD_main_CV.py`. 

If you are interested in fitting the model to **your data**, you can check the `example0` folder for a minimum, toy example of fitting a reduced-rank regression (RRR) encoding model to an example IBL session with 100 trials. I attached the data in the `example0` folder so that you can run the code directly and get a hands-on experience.

If you are interested in fitting the model to [**IBL data**](https://viz.internationalbrainlab.org/), you can check the `example1` folder for a comprehansive example of fitting a reduced-rank regression (RRR) encoding model to a large dataset including 100+ session Neuropixels recordings of 10,000+ neurons.
